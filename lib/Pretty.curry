--- The abstract data type Doc represents pretty documents.
data Doc = Doc (Tokens -> Tokens)

deDoc (Doc d) = d

--- The empty document is, indeed, empty. Although empty has no content,
--- it does have a 'height' of 1 and behaves exactly like (text "") 
--- (and is therefore not a unit of <code>&lt;$&gt;</code>).
--- @return an empty document
empty :: Doc
empty = text ""

--- Is the document empty?
isEmpty :: Doc -> Bool
isEmpty (Doc d) = d Empty == Text "" Empty

--- The document (text s) contains the literal string s. 
--- The string shouldn't contain any newline ('\n') characters. 
--- If the string contains newline characters, 
--- the function <code>string</code> should be used.
--- @param s - a string without newline ('\n') characters
--- @return a document which contains the literal string
text :: String -> Doc
text s = Doc (Text s)

--- The document (linesep s) advances to the next line and indents to the current
--- nesting level. Document (linesep s) behaves like (text s) if the line break 
--- is undone by group.
--- @param s - a string
--- @return a document which advances to the next line or behaves like (text s)
linesep :: String -> Doc
linesep = Doc . Line

--- The line document advances to the next line and indents to the current
--- nesting level. Document line behaves like (text " ") if the line break 
--- is undone by group.
--- @return a document which advances to the next line or behaves like (text " ")
line :: Doc
line = linesep " "

--- The linebreak document advances to the next line and indents to 
--- the current nesting level. Document linebreak behaves like empty 
--- if the line break is undone by group.
--- @return a document which advances to the next line or behaves like (text "")
linebreak :: Doc
linebreak = linesep ""

--- The document softline behaves like <code>space</code> if the resulting output 
--- fits the page, otherwise it behaves like <code>line</code>.<br><br>
--- <code>softline  = group line</code>
--- @return a document which behaves like <code>space</code> or <code>line</code>
softline :: Doc
softline = group line

--- The document softbreak behaves like <code>empty</code> if the resulting output 
--- fits the page, otherwise it behaves like <code>line</code>.<br><br>
--- <code>softbreak  = group linebreak</code>
--- @return a document which behaves like <code>empty</code> or <code>line</code>
softbreak :: Doc
softbreak = group linebreak

--- The group combinator is used to specify alternative layouts. 
--- The document (group x) undoes all line breaks in document x. 
--- The resulting line is added to the current line if that fits the page. 
--- Otherwise, the document x is rendered without any changes.
--- @param d - a document
--- @return document d without line breaks if that fits the page.
group :: Doc -> Doc
group d = Doc (Open . deDoc d . Close)

--- The document (nest i d) renders document d with the current 
--- indentation level increased by i (See also <code>hang</code>, 
--- <code>align</code> and <code>indent</code>).<br><br>
--- <code>nest 2 (text "hello" &lt;$&gt; text "world") &lt;$&gt; text "!"</code><br><br>
--- outputs as:<br><br>
--- <code>hello</code><br>
--- <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;world</code><br>
--- <code>!</code>
--- @param i - an integer which increases the indentation level
--- @param d - a document
--- @return document d with an indentation level increased by i
nest :: Int -> Doc -> Doc
nest i d = Doc (OpenNest (\ms@(m:_) _ _ -> (m+i):ms) . deDoc d . CloseNest)

--- The hang combinator implements hanging indentation. 
--- The document (hang i d) renders document d with a nesting level set 
--- to the current column plus i. The following example uses hanging 
--- indentation for some text:<br><br>
--- <code>test = hang 4 (fillSep (map text </code><br>
--- <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
--- (words "the hang combinator indents these words !")))</code><br><br>
--- Which lays out on a page with a width of 20 characters as:<br><br>
--- <code>the hang combinator</code><br>
--- <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indents these</code><br>
--- <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;words !</code><br><br>
--- The hang combinator is implemented as:<br><br>
--- <code>hang i x  = align (nest i x)</code>
--- @param i - an integer which increases the indentation level
--- @param d - a document
--- @return document d with an indentation level set to the current column plus i
hang :: Int -> Doc -> Doc
hang i d = Doc (OpenNest (\ms r w -> (w-r+i):ms) . deDoc d . CloseNest)

--- The document (align d) renders document d with the nesting level 
--- set to the current column. It is used for example to implement hang.<br>
--- As an example, we will put a document right above another one, 
--- regardless of the current nesting level:<br><br>
--- <code>x $$ y  = align (x &lt;$&gt; y)</code><br>
--- <code>test    = text "hi" &lt;+&gt; (text "nice" $$ text "world")</code><br><br>
--- which will be layed out as:<br><br>
--- <code>hi nice</code><br>
--- <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world</code>
--- @param d - a document
--- @return document d with the nesting level set to the current column
align :: Doc -> Doc
align = hang 0

--- The document (combine x l r) encloses document x between 
--- documents l and r using (&lt;&gt;).<br><br>
--- <code>combine x l r   = l &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; r</code>
--- @param x - the middle document
