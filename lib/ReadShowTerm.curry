--- Transforms a ground(!) term into a string representation

--- Thus, showTerm suspends until its argument is ground.
--- This function is similar to the prelude function <code>show</code>
--- but can read the string back with <code>readUnqualifiedTerm</code>
--- (provided that the constructor names are unique without the module
--- qualifier).

--- Transforms a ground(!) term into a string representation

--- Note that this function differs from the prelude function <code>show</code>
--- since it prefixes constructors with their module name
--- in order to read them back with <code>readQTerm</code>.

--- Transform a string containing a term in standard prefix notation
--- without module qualifiers into the corresponding data term.
--- The first argument is a non-empty list of module qualifiers that are tried to
--- prefix the constructor in the string in order to get the qualified constructors
--- (that must be defined in the current program!).
--- In case of a successful parse, the result is a one element list
--- containing a pair of the data term and the remaining unparsed string.
