This directory contains a compiler for database applications
specified by entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) into Curry programs.
The basic ideas and details about this approach are described in

B. Brassel, M. Hanus, M. Mueller:
High-Level Database Programming in Curry
In Proc. of the Tenth International Symposium on
Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages (PADL 2008), 
Springer LNCS, 2008

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic use with Umbrello UML Modeller:

1. Create an XML description of the ERD (with Umbrello)
   in xmi format, e.g., stored in "myerd.xmi".

2. Compile it into a Curry program with

   erd2curry myerd.xmi


Use without Umbrello UML Modeller and XML files:

1. Create an ERD description as a Curry term of type ERD
   (w.r.t. type definition given in module ERD.curry), e.g.,
   stored in "myerd.term".

2. Compile it into a Curry program with

   erd2curry -t myerd.term

Visualization:
--------------

To visualize an ERD term as a graph with dotty, execute

erd2curry -v myerd.term


Inclusion in the Curry application:
-----------------------------------

To compile the generated database code, include this directory
into your Curry module path or copy the file ERDGeneric.curry
into the directory of the generated database code.
