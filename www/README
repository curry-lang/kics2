This directory contains the scripts for managing CGI servers that
are executed to generate dynamic web pages implemented with the library HTML.
The CGI servers manage the event handlers used in dynamic web pages
on the server side. Usually, the servers are automatically started
whenever it is necessary to process a dynamic web page. Since these
processes will not be explicitly terminated, it is sometimes necessary
to consider the set of all servers on a machine in order to control
their resources. This is the purpose of the commands in this directory.


The following shell commands can be used to manage the CGI server processes:

> make show

Shows all currently active servers (name and pids)


> make sketch

Sketches the status of all currently active servers
(date of next cleanup and dates of all currently stored event handlers)


> make cleanServers

Starts a cleanup on each server (usually, this is implicitly started
whenever a dynamic web page is requested), i.e., expired event handlers
are deleted. Morever, servers which are inactive for a long time
(the exact period is defined in HTML.cgiServerExpiration) are terminated.
Thus, it is a good idea to execute this command periodically, e.g.,
via a cron job.


> make stop

Stops all currently active servers (however, there are automatically
restarted when a user requests the corresponding dynamic web page)
by sending them a termination message.


> make kill

Kills all currently active servers by killing their processes.
This could be used instead of "make stop" if the server don't
react for some reason.


The use of stop/kill might be necessary in order to restart servers
that have required too much resources without free them (which could
be the case if the underlying run-time system does not deallocate
memory).
