-- The tool is rather simple, it uses Curry's facilities for 
-- meta-programming to read the program in the form defined 
-- in the AbstractCurry module. 
-- The libraries for meta-programming provides commands to read
-- AbstractCurry programs typed and untyped.
-- By comparing the results of these two operations, we are able to
-- distinguish the inferred types from those given by the programmer.
-- 
-- addtypes makes use of the CurryStringClassifier, cf. function addTypes.


--- addtypes is supposed to get its argument, the file to add type signatures
--- to from the shell.

--- addtypes implements a simple algorithm to decide where to add type 
--- information. Find the first line wich contains the function name 
--- on the left hand side and insert the type annotation before that line.
--- The problem with this algorithm is that it might get confused by 
--- comments. This is where the Curry string classifier comes in.
--- After using CussryStringClassifier.scan the function addTypes only 
--- has to process "Code" tokens and can be sure that there will be no
--- confusion with Comments, Strings or Chars within the program.
