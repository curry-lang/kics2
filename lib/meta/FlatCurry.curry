-- Definition of data types for representing FlatCurry programs:
-- =============================================================

--- Data type for representing a Curry module in the intermediate form.
--- A value of this data type has the form
--- <CODE>
---  (Prog modname imports typedecls functions opdecls translation_table)
--- </CODE>
--- where modname: name of this module,
---       imports: list of modules names that are imported,
---       typedecls, opdecls, functions, translation of type names
---       and constructor/function names: see below

data Prog = Prog String [String] [TypeDecl] [FuncDecl] [OpDecl]


--- The data type for representing qualified names.
--- In FlatCurry all names are qualified to avoid name clashes.
--- The first component is the module name and the second component the
--- unqualified name as it occurs in the source program.
type QName = (String,String)

--- Data type to specify the visibility of various entities.

data Visibility = Public    -- public (exported) entity
                | Private   -- private entity

--- The data type for representing type variables.
--- They are represented by (TVar i) where i is a type variable index.
type TVarIndex = Int

--- Data type for representing definitions of algebraic data types.
---
--- A data type definition of the form
---
--- <code>data t x1...xn = ...| c t1....tkc |...</code>
---
--- is represented by the FlatCurry term
---
--- <code>(Type t [i1,...,in] [...(Cons c kc [t1,...,tkc])...])</code>
---
--- where each <code>ij</code> is the index of the type variable
--- <code>xj</code>.
---
--- Note: the type variable indices are unique inside each type declaration
---       and are usually numbered from 0
---
--- Thus, a data type declaration consists of the name of the data type,
--- a list of type parameters and a list of constructor declarations.

data TypeDecl = Type    QName Visibility [TVarIndex] [ConsDecl]
              | TypeSyn QName Visibility [TVarIndex] TypeExpr

--- A constructor declaration consists of the name and arity of the
--- constructor and a list of the argument types of the constructor.

data ConsDecl = Cons QName Int Visibility [TypeExpr]


--- Data type for type expressions.
--- A type expression is either a type variable, a function type,
--- or a type constructor application.
---
--- Note: the names of the predefined type constructors are
---       "Int", "Float", "Bool", "Char", "IO", "Success",
---       "()" (unit type), "(,...,)" (tuple types), "[]" (list type)

data TypeExpr =
     TVar TVarIndex                 -- type variable
   | FuncType TypeExpr TypeExpr     -- function type t1->t2
   | TCons QName [TypeExpr]         -- type constructor application
                                    -- TCons module name typeargs


--- Data type for operator declarations.
--- An operator declaration "fix p n" in Curry corresponds to the
--- FlatCurry term (Op n fix p).

data OpDecl = Op QName Fixity Int

--- Data types for the different choices for the fixity of an operator.
data Fixity = InfixOp | InfixlOp | InfixrOp


--- Data type for representing object variables.
--- Object variables occurring in expressions are represented by (Var i)
--- where i is a variable index.

type VarIndex = Int


--- Data type for representing function declarations.
---
--- A function declaration in FlatCurry is a term of the form
---
--- <code>(Func name arity type (Rule [i_1,...,i_arity] e))</code>
---
--- and represents the function "name" with definition
---
--- <code>name :: type</code><br/>
--- <code>name x_1...x_arity = e</code>
---
--- where each <code>i_j</code> is the index of the variable <code>x_j</code>.
---
--- Note: the variable indices are unique inside each function declaration
---       and are usually numbered from 0
---
--- External functions are represented as
--- <code>(Func name arity type (External s))</code>
--- where s is the external name associated to this function.
---
--- Thus, a function declaration consists of the name, arity, type, and rule.

data FuncDecl = Func QName Int Visibility TypeExpr Rule


--- A rule is either a list of formal parameters together with an expression
--- or an "External" tag.

data Rule = Rule [VarIndex] Expr
          | External String

--- Data type for classifying case expressions.
--- Case expressions can be either flexible or rigid in Curry.

data CaseType = Rigid | Flex       -- type of a case expression

--- Data type for classifying combinations
--- (i.e., a function/constructor applied to some arguments).
--- @cons FuncCall     - a call to a function where all arguments are provided
--- @cons ConsCall     - a call with a constructor at the top, all arguments are provided
--- @cons FuncPartCall - a partial call to a function (i.e., not all arguments
---                      are provided) where the parameter is the number of
---                      missing arguments
--- @cons ConsPartCall - a partial call to a constructor (i.e., not all arguments
---                      are provided) where the parameter is the number of
---                      missing arguments

data CombType = FuncCall | ConsCall | FuncPartCall Int | ConsPartCall Int

--- Data type for representing expressions.
---
--- Remarks:
---
--- <ol>
--- <li> if-then-else expressions are represented as function calls:
---
---    <code>(if e1 then e2 else e3)</code>
---
---    is represented as
---
---    <code>(Comb FuncCall ("Prelude","if_then_else") [e1,e2,e3])</code>
--- </li>
--- <li>
---    Higher-order applications are represented as calls to the (external)
---    function "apply". For instance, the rule
---
---      <code>app f x = f x</code>
---
---    is represented as
---
---    <code>(Rule  [0,1] (Comb FuncCall ("Prelude","apply") [Var 0, Var 1]))</code>
--- </li>
--- <li>
---    A conditional rule is represented as a call to an external function
---    "cond" where the first argument is the condition (a constraint).
---    For instance, the rule
---
---      <code>equal2 x | x=:=2 = success</code>
---
---    is represented as
---
---     <code>(Rule [0]
---            (Comb FuncCall ("Prelude","cond")
---                  [Comb FuncCall ("Prelude","=:=") [Var 0, Lit (Intc 2)],
---                   Comb FuncCall ("Prelude","success") []]))</code>
--- </li>
--- </ol>
---
--- @cons Var - variable (represented by unique index)
--- @cons Lit - literal (Integer/Float/Char constant)
--- @cons Comb - application (f e1 ... en) of function/constructor f
---              with n&lt;=arity(f)
--- @cons Free - introduction of free local variables
--- @cons Or - disjunction of two expressions (used to translate rules
---            with overlapping left-hand sides)
--- @cons Case - case distinction (rigid or flex)

data Expr = Var VarIndex 
          | Lit Literal
          | Comb CombType QName [Expr]
          | Let [(VarIndex,Expr)] Expr
          | Free [VarIndex] Expr
          | Or Expr Expr
          | Case CaseType Expr [BranchExpr]


--- Data type for representing branches in a case expression.
---
--- Branches "(m.c x1...xn) -> e" in case expressions are represented as
---
---   (Branch (Pattern (m,c) [i1,...,in]) e)
---
--- where each ij is the index of the pattern variable xj, or as
---
---   (Branch (LPattern (Intc i)) e)
---
--- for integers as branch patterns (similarly for other literals
--- like float or character constants).

data BranchExpr = Branch Pattern Expr

--- Data type for representing patterns in case expressions.

data Pattern = Pattern QName [VarIndex]
             | LPattern Literal

--- Data type for representing literals occurring in an expression
--- or case branch. It is either an integer, a float, or a character constant.

data Literal = Intc   Int
             | Floatc Float
             | Charc  Char

--- I/O action which parses a Curry program and returns the corresponding
