import Global

--- Returns the current cpu time of the process in milliseconds.

getCPUTime :: IO Int
getCPUTime external

--- Returns the current elapsed time of the process in milliseconds.
--- This operation is not supported (always returns 0),
--- only included for compatibility reasons.

getElapsedTime :: IO Int
getElapsedTime external

--- Returns the list of the program's command line arguments.
--- The program name is not included.

getArgs :: IO [String]
getArgs external

--- Returns the value of an environment variable.
--- The empty string is returned for undefined environment variables.

getEnviron :: String -> IO String
getEnviron evar = do
  envs <- readGlobal environ
  maybe (prim_getEnviron $## evar) return (lookup evar envs)

prim_getEnviron :: String -> IO String
prim_getEnviron external

--- internal state of environment variables set via setEnviron
environ :: Global [(String,String)]
environ = global [] Temporary

--- Set an environment variable to a value.
--- The new value will be passed to subsequent shell commands
--- (see <code>system</code>) and visible to subsequent calls to
--- <code>getEnviron</code> (but it is not visible in the environment
--- of the process that started the program execution).

setEnviron :: String -> String -> IO ()
setEnviron evar val = do
  envs <- readGlobal environ
  writeGlobal environ ((evar,val) : filter ((/=evar) . fst) envs)

--- Removes an environment variable that has been set by
--- <code>setEnviron</code>.

unsetEnviron :: String -> IO ()
unsetEnviron evar = do
  envs <- readGlobal environ
  writeGlobal environ (filter ((/=evar) . fst) envs)

--- Returns the hostname of the machine running this process.

getHostname :: IO String
getHostname external

--- Returns the process identifier of the current Curry process.

getPID :: IO Int
getPID external


--- Returns the name of the current program, i.e., the name of the
--- main module currently executed.

getProgName :: IO String
getProgName external


--- Executes a shell command and return with the exit code of the command.
--- An exit status of zero means successful execution.

system :: String -> IO Int

   envs <- readGlobal environ

prim_system :: String -> IO Int
prim_system external


--- Terminates the execution of the current Curry program
--- and returns the exit code given by the argument.
--- An exit code of zero means successful execution.

exitWith :: Int -> IO _
exitWith exitcode = prim_exitWith $# exitcode

prim_exitWith :: Int -> IO _
prim_exitWith external


--- The evaluation of the action (sleep n) puts the Curry process
--- asleep for n seconds.

sleep :: Int -> IO ()
sleep n = prim_sleep $# n

prim_sleep :: Int -> IO ()
prim_sleep external

--- Is the underlying operating system a POSIX system (unix, MacOS)?
isPosix :: Bool
isPosix = not isWindows

--- Is the underlying operating system a Windows system?
isWindows :: Bool
isWindows external
