--- The Curry string classifier is a simple tool to process strings containing 
--- Curry source code. The source string is classified into the following
--- categories:
---
--- (1) moduleHead - module interface, imports, operators
---
--- (2) code - the part where the actual program is defined
---
--- (3) big comment - parts enclosed in {- ... -}
---
--- (4) small comment - from "--" to the end of a line
---
--- (5) text - a string, i.e. text enclosed in "..."
---
--- (6) letter - the given string is the representation of a character
---
--- (7) meta - containing information for meta programming
---
--- For an example to use the state scanner cf. addtypes, the tool 
--- to add function types to a given program.
