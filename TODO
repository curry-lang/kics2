Things we have to do
====================

- $! still uses try which is highly inefficient

- generate instances for match and get rid of try

- Replace the generic <= in PermSort with a specialiced lt_int
  for a benchmark

- Literal pattern like f 'a' = 'b' are not fully tested, especially for exotic
  characters (e.g., characters above (chr 127)).

- Functions in data structures
