;;; Commentary:

;; Purpose:
;;
;; To send a Curry buffer to another buffer running a PAKCS interpreter
;; The functions are adapted from  the Hugs Mode developed by
;;         Chris Van Humbeeck <chris.vanhumbeeck@cs.kuleuven.ac.be>
;;
;; Installation:
;; 
;; To use with the Curry mode of 
;;        Moss&Thorn <http://www.curry.org/curry-mode>
;; add this to .emacs:
;;
;;    (add-hook curry-mode-hook 'turn-on-curry-pakcs)
;;
;; Customisation:
;;       The name of the pakcs interpreter is in variable
;;          curry-pakcs-program-name
;;       Arguments can be sent to the PAKCS interpreter when it is called
;;       by setting the value of the variable
;;          curry-pakcs-program-args
;;
;;       This value can be interactively by calling C-cC-s with an
;;       argument. 
;;
;;       If the command does not seem to respond, see the
;;          content of the `comint-prompt-regexp' variable
;;          to check that it waits for the appropriate PAKCS prompt
;;          the current value is appropriate for PAKCS 1.6
;;
;;
;;    `curry-pakcs-hook' is invoked in the *pakcs* once it is started.
;;    
;;; All functions/variables start with
;;; `(turn-(on/off)-)curry-pakcs' or `curry-pakcs-'.
