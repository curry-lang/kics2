--- This module contains a collection of functions for
--- obtaining lists of solutions to constraints.
--- These operations are useful to encapsulate
--- non-deterministic operations between I/O actions in
--- order to connects the worlds of logic and functional programming
--- and to avoid non-determinism failures on the I/O level.
---
--- In contrast the "old" concept of encapsulated search
--- (which could be applied to any subexpression in a computation),
--- the operations to encapsulate search in this module
--- are I/O actions in order to avoid some anomalities
--- in the old concept.
