This directory contains the scripts for CPNS,
the Curry Port Name Server, which is responsible for managing the
symbolic names assigned to the named ports on a local machine.

start: script to start the CPNS demon on the local machine
       This script will be automatically called by curry2prolog.

stop:  script to stop the CPNS demon (usually not used)

The implementation of the CPNS demon in Curry is contained in the
system library CPNS (since it is imported by the library Ports)
based on primitive socket operations.
