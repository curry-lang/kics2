This directory contains a Curry mode for Emacs adapted from Haskell.
To use it, add the following to your .emacs file (adapt the first
line according to your local KiCS2 installation):

(setq load-path (cons "/home/joe/kics2/tools/emacs/" load-path))
(setq auto-mode-alist
      (append auto-mode-alist
              '(("\\.curry$"  . curry-mode)
                ("\\.lcurry$"  . literate-curry-mode))))
(autoload 'curry-mode "curry-mode"
         "Major mode for editing Curry programs." t)
(autoload 'literate-curry-mode "curry-mode"
         "Major mode for editing literate Curry scripts." t)

(add-hook 'curry-mode-hook 'turn-on-curry-font-lock)
(add-hook 'curry-mode-hook 'turn-on-curry-decl-scan)
(add-hook 'curry-mode-hook 'turn-on-curry-pakcs)

If you have "kics2" in your load path, then you can load Curry programs
from a buffer containing a Curry program with the following keys:

C-c C-l: load file into KiCS2
C-c C-r: reload file into KiCS2
C-c C-b: go to KiCS2 buffer
