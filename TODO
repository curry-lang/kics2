Things we have to do
====================

- $! still uses try which is highly inefficient

- generate instances for match and get rid of try

- The frontend generates FlatCurry files in the curry subdir respective to the
  directory in which a module is found. This may cause trouble with library
  modules, especially in case of insufficient file permissions.
