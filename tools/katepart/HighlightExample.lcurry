This is normal text.

You can write code using bird tracks:

> {- This is a multiline comment,
>    spanning two lines.
> -}
>
> {-# Pragma1,
>     Pragma2
> #-}

Or using LaTeX style code blocks:

\begin{code}
module SyntaxHighlighting
  ( module SyntaxHighlighting
  , Data (..), Type, function
  ) where

import qualified Maybe as Maybe hiding
  ( fromJust
  , fromMaybe
  )

import missspelling
\end{code}

Another option are spec blocks:

\begin{spec}
-- This is a single line comment

--- Currydoc info
--- second line.
type Type = ()

data Data
  = Cons1
  | Cons2

type Record =
  { field1 :: Bool
  , field2 :: Int
  }

function :: Int -> Int
function _ = id local
  where local = 42

special = ()
  where hiding = 1 -- no keyword!
        as     = 2 -- no keyword!
\end{spec}

Or flipped bird tracks:

< char = 'a'
<
< string = "A string"
<
< octal = 0o123
<
< hex = 0x42
<
< enum = [1 .. 2]
