Things we have to do
====================

- $! still uses try which is highly inefficient
- generate instances for match and get rid of try
- Replace the generic <= in PermSort with a specialiced lt_int
  for a benchmark
- Literal pattern like f 'a' = 'b' are not fully tested, especially for exotic
  characters (e.g., characters above (chr 127)).
- set functions
- test function patterns
- IO
- repair --no-opt compiler option
- sharing of non-determinism is less efficient than in KiCS
- sharing of non-determinism and free vars is less efficient than in KiCS
- repair search strategies bfs, iterative deepening
- eta-expansion of deterministic functions (optimizing)
  Update: It seems like this functionality has been included in the frontend
  but disabled for PAKCS. Maybe we can reactivate it.
