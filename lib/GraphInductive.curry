--- Library for inductive graphs (port of a Haskell library by Martin Erwig).
---
--- In this library, graphs are composed and decomposed in an inductive way.
---
--- The key idea is as follows: 
---
--- A graph is either <i>empty</i> or it consists of <i>node context</i> 
--- and a <i>graph g'</i> which 
--- are put together by a constructor <code>(:&amp;)</code>.
---
--- This constructor <code>(:&amp;)</code>, however, is not a constructor in 
--- the sense of abstract 
--- data type, but more basically a defined constructing funtion. 
---
--- A <i>context</i> is a node together withe the edges to and from this node into
--- the nodes in the graph g'.
--- 
--- For examples of how to use this library, cf. the module "GraphAlgorithms".

--- (:&amp;) takes a node-context and a Graph and yields a new graph.
---
--- The according key idea is detailed at the beginning.
--- 
--- nl is the type of the node labels and el the edge labels.
---
--- Note that it is an error to induce a context for 
--- a node already contained in the graph.

--- The type variables of Graph are <i>nodeLabel</i> and <i>edgeLabel</i>.
--- The internal representation of Graph is hidden.

data Graph nodeLabel edgeLabel = Gr (GraphRep nodeLabel edgeLabel)

--- Nodes and edges themselves (in contrast to their labels) are coded as integers.
---
--- For both of them, there are variants as labeled, unlabelwd and quasi unlabeled 
--- (labeled with ()).
---
-- Nodes and their labels
---
--- Unlabeled node
type  Node   = Int

--- Quasi-unlabeled edge
type UEdge   = LEdge ()         

--- The context of a node is the node itself (along with label) and its adjacent nodes.
--- Thus, a context is a quadrupel, for node n it is of the form
--- (edges to n,node n,n's label,edges from n)

--- Labeled links to or from a 'Node'.

-- graph decomposition
------------------------------------

--- decompose a graph into the 'Context' for an arbitrarily-chosen 'Node'
--- and the remaining 'Graph'.
--- 
--- In order to use graphs as abstract data structures, we also need means to
--- decompose a graph. This decompostion should work as much like pattern matching
--- as possible. The normal matching is done by the function matchAny, which takes
--- a graph and yields a graph decompostion.
---
--- According to the main idea, matchAny . (:&amp;) should be an identity.

--- A graph decompostion is a context for a node n and the remaining graph without
--- that node.
