KiCS2: The Kiel Curry System (Version 2)
========================================

KiCS2 is an implementation of the multi-paradigm declarative language
[Curry programs](http://www.curry-language.org) developed by the
[Programming Languages and Compiler Construction](http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/en/prog/)
group at the [University of Kiel](http://www.uni-kiel.de/).
KiCS2 compiles Curry programs into [Haskell programs](http://www.haskell.org/)
using the [Glasgow Haskell Compiler](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/)
as its back end.
Similarly to many other implementations of Curry,
KiCS2 has an interactive environment (read/eval/print loop)
to ease the development of Curry applications.

This directory contains:

`INSTALL.txt`:
Instructions how to install the system.

`GITINSTALL.txt`:
Instructions how to install the system fro the GIT repository.

`bin`:
A directory containing various executables
to execute the components of KiCS2.

`cpns`:
This directory contains scripts and executables for the
Curry Port Name Server (CPNS) which is responsible for managing the
symbolic names assigned to the named sockets on a local machine
(see library `NamedSocket` for more details).

`currytools`:
This directory contains various tools for Curry
(see the README there for a more detailed description).

`docs`:
This directory contains some documentation, in particular,
the KiCS2 User Manual.

`frontend`: 
This directory contains the Curry front-end, i.e., a parser for
Curry programs. It is adapted from the parser of the
[Muenster Curry Compiler](http://danae.uni-muenster.de/~lux/curry/).

`include`:
This directory contains some resources which are included
by various tools delivered with KiCS2.

`lib`:
 This directory contains a collection of standard libraries
implemented in Curry (including the standard prelude).

`runtime`:
This directory contains Haskell programs used by the run time
system of KiCS2.

`src`:
This directory contains the implementation of the KiCS2 compiler
and interactive environment. Note that both are implemented
in Curry so that some bootstrapping is necessary to generate
the complete system.

`scripts`:
This directory contains some templates for scripts used by KiCS2.

`testsuite`:
This directory contains a collection of Curry programs
implementing unit tests to check the functionality of the system using
the currytest tool. All tests can be executed by the shell script
`doTest` in this directory.

`tools`:
This directory contains various tools for the KiCS2 system.

`utils`:
This directory contains some utilities, in particular,
for installing KiCS2 on Windows operating systems.

`www`:
This directory contains scripts and executables for the
event handler server that is required to execute dynamic web
pages implemented with the libraries HTML or WUI.
