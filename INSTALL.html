<h1>KiCS2: The Kiel Curry System (Version 2)</h1>
<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
<p>
KiCS2 compiles
<a href="http://www.curry-language.org" target="_blank">Curry programs</a>
into <a href="http://www.haskell.org/" target="_blank">Haskell programs</a>.
This distribution runs on Unix-based platforms
and has been developed and tested under Linux (Ubuntu).
However, it should also run under similar platforms like SunOS or Mac OS X.
If you want to install and run the complete system
on your computer, you need a Haskell implementation,
in particular the
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/" target="_blank">Glasgow Haskell Compiler</a> and
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/cabal/" target="_blank">Cabal</a>,
a Haskell package management system.
For instance, if you run Ubuntu Linux, you can easily install
these packages by
</p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install ghc6 cabal-install
</pre>
<p>
After unpacking the distribution file, go into the main directory
of the distribution (which is denoted by <tt><em>kics2home</em></tt>
in the following):
</p>
<pre>
  tar xvzf kics2.tar.gz
  cd kics2
</pre>
<p>
If you install KiCS2 for the first time, you need to install
some Haskell packages via Cabal, i.e., run the command
</p>
<pre>
  make installhaskell
</pre>
<p>
Now you are ready to install KiCS2 with all its components by
</p>
<pre>
  make
</pre>
<p>
When the installation is finished (it will take some time),
the commands to use KiCS2 are installed in the local
directory <tt>bin</tt>.
In order to use the system easily,
add the directory "<tt><em>kics2home/</em>bin</tt>"
to your path, e.g., by the command
"<tt>export PATH=$PATH:<em>kics2home</em>/bin</tt>"
in the <tt>bash</tt>.
Now you can start KiCS2 via the command <tt>kics2</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ol>
<li>
The current distribution is designed as a local user installation
since some system libraries are re-compiled according to the current options.
Thus, it is not a good idea to install this distribution globally
where users have no write permission.
</li>
<li>
You can configure the behavior of KiCS2 by various settings
in the file <tt>~/.kics2rc</tt> which is created when you use
KiCS2 for the first time.
</li>
<li>
  If you like to have support for <em>line editing or history functionality</em>
  in the KiCS2 interactive environment (as supported by the readline
  library), you should have the Unix/Linux command "rlwrap" installed
  on your local machine (e.g., by "<tt>sudo apt-get install rlwrap</tt>").
  KiCS2 uses "rlwrap" if called on a terminal
  without the parameter "--noreadline".
</li>
<li>
If you want to use the <b>library for GUI programming in Curry</b>
(<em>kics2home/</em><tt>lib/GUI.curry</tt>), you need also a
Tcl/Tk implementation (including the windowing shell <tt>wish</tt>)
which can be downloaded
<a href="http://www.scriptics.com/software/tcltk/">here</a> or
installed in a Ubuntu distribution by
"<tt>sudo apt-get install tk tcl</tt>".
In this case, the windowing shell <tt>wish</tt> must be
in your path (or you can also modify the definition of the
operation <tt>openGuiPort</tt> in the library <tt>GUI.curry</tt>).
</li>
</ol>


<h3>Changing system constants:</h3>

The distribution of KiCS2 is configured with a
<b>maximal tuple arity of 15</b>, i.e., Curry programs containing larger
tuple sizes cannot be compiled. If you want to increase this size
(usually, it is preferable to change your program), you have to change
(in a source distribution of KiCS2)
two system files and install your system as follows:
<ol>
<li>
Change the definition of the constant <code>maxTupleArity</code>
in the files <tt><em>kics2home/</em>mccparser/src/PatchPrelude.hs</tt>
according to your required maximal arity.
</li>
<li>
Delete the file <tt><em>kics2home/</em>lib/.curry/Prelude.fcy</tt>.
</li>
<li>
Re-install KiCS2 by running <tt>make</tt>.
</li>
</ol>
