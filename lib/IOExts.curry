--- Executes a command with a new default shell process.
--- The input and output streams of the new process is returned
--- as one handle which is both readable and writable.
--- Thus, writing to the handle produces input to the process and
--- output from the process can be retrieved by reading from this handle.
--- The handle should be closed with <code>IO.hClose</code> since they are not
--- closed automatically when the process terminates.
--- @param cmd - the shell command to be executed
--- @return the handle connected to the input/output streams
---         of the new process

--- An action that reads the complete contents of a file and returns it.
--- This action can be used instead of the (lazy) <code>readFile</code>
--- action if the contents of the file might be changed.

--- @return the complete contents of the file

--- @param file - the name of the file

--- Forces the exclusive execution of an action via a lock file.
--- For instance, (exclusiveIO "myaction.lock" act) ensures that
--- the action "act" is not executed by two processes on the same
--- system at the same time.

--- @param action - the action to be exclusively executed
--- @return the result of the execution of the action
