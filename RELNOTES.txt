Release Notes for KiCS2
=======================

Release notes for KiCS2 Version 0.3.1 (under development)
---------------------------------------------------------

Changes to version 0.3.0:

  * REPL: new (experimental) options `prelude` (for defining the name
    of the standard prelude) and `parser` (for setting additional
    front-end options) included.
  * Library `Distribution`: front-end parameters extended by supporting
    "special" (i.e., aribrary) arguments.
  * Library `Distribution` and `FlatCurry`: after calling the front end,
    an exception is raised if the front end returns with an error
    (due to an illegal source program).
  * Library `HTML`: `formMetaInfo` added, HTML header changed to HTML5.
  * Library `List`: Improved version of `inits` added.
  * Library `Prelude`: Functions `forIO`, `forIO_`, `when`, `unless` added.
  * Tool `erd2curry` updated to support easier installation.
    Bug fix in code generation w.r.t. checking of cardinality constraints.
  * Tool `spicey` (web framework) added and updated with a RESTful interface
    for entities.

-------------------------------------

Changes to version 0.2.4:

  * Front-end updated (it writes and reads new kinds of interface files
    with the suffix `.icurry`).
  * The default search strategy has been changed to *breadth-first search*.
  * Fixed a bug in `IO.hGetLine` which caused an end-of-file error when
    reading a non-empty line without a newline termination.
  * Compilation scheme changed so that each function has an additional
    argument indicating the encapsulation level in order to obtain
    a reasonable implementation of nested encapsulated set functions with
    possible higher-order functions.
  * Library `UnsafeSearchTree` added. This library is similarly to
    `SearchTree` but does not evaluate unbound local variables
    to their ground values. Thus, one can have results containing
    unbound variables (which can be checked by the operations
    `isVar` and `getVarId`).


Release notes for KiCS2 Version 0.2.4
-------------------------------------

Changes to version 0.2.3:

  * Fixed a long standing bug which occured in combination with locally
    polymorphic sub-expressions. For example, in the rule
    `f = fst (3, id)` the identifier `id` has type `forall a . a -> a`,
    but the type variable `a` does not occur in the type of `f`.
    This lead to a type error in the generated Haskell sources.
    The compiler now solves this problem by replacing such type variables
    with the unit type `()`, thus the above mentioned rule becomes
    `f = fst (3, id :: () -> ())`.
  * The compiler now uses type inference for FlatCurry programs to
    improve the generated Haskell files.
  * Library `Function` added.
  * The installation process now uses `cabal`'s capabilities to install
    all required and locally generated Haskell packages into the installation
    directory, inside a new directory `pkg`.
    As a consequence, the installation process no longer depends on packages
    to be installed for the user.
    Furthermore, different versions of the KiCS2 compiler can now
    be installed in parallel, even when they are configured
    to use different versions of GHC.
  * Library `Prelude`: operations for encapsulated search omitted
    since the base primitive `try` is not implemented.
    Use libraries `AllSolutions`, `SearchTree`, and `SetFunctions`
    for encapsulated search.
  * Library `SearchTree`: operation `getAllValuesWith` added,
    operation `someValueBy` slightly changed and renamed to `someValueWith`.
  * Internal constructor in library FiniteMap changed.
    As a consequence, compiler intermediate (analysis) files produced
    by previous KiCS2 versions are incompatible to this version.
  * CASS tool (Curry Analysis Server System) added and integrated
    into currydoc.
  * Library `HTML`: default (white) background for body of generated
    web pages removed (since this is usually defined in css files).
  * Type inference tool (see `currytools/typeinference`) added.
    This tool can be used to annotate expressions in FlatCurry programs
    with their type.


Release notes for KiCS2 Version 0.2.3
-------------------------------------

Changes to version 0.2.2:

  * The KiCS2 REPL now supports the configuration of the user prompt
    via `:set prompt <prompt>`.

  * Syntax highlighting for KDE's editor component `katepart` added,
    supporting Curry and Literate Curry.

  * A frontend bug leading to an internal erroe when using as patterns
    inside functional patterns is fixed.

  * Some bugs regarding the combination of functional patterns and
    nonlinear left-hand-sides are fixed. The parser also accepts
    as-patterns inside functional patterns.

  * The GHC and cabal binaries used for installation can now be
    explicitly set. See the installation instructions for details.

  * Windows support for kernel installation.

    The KiCS2 kernel system (`kics2c`, `kics2`, `cleancurry`, `cymake`) can
    now be installed under Windows using MinGW. See the installation
    instructions for details.

  * Library module `Directory` updated and extended.

    - Replacement of `String` by `FilePath`
    - Added new function `createDirectoryIfMissing :: Bool -> FilePath -> IO ()`
    - Added new function `getHomeDirectory :: IO FilePath`
    - Added new function `getTemporaryDirectory :: IO FilePath`
    - Added new function `copyFile :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO ()`

  * Library `SetFunctions`: Operations `choose` and `select` added.

  * The front end accepts typed expressions of the form "Expr :: TypeExpr".
    Such type annotations are considered by the compiler.
    For instance, `(unknown :: Bool)` evaluates to `False` or `True`.

  * Library `FlatCurry` extended to represent typed expressions
    by a new constructor `Typed`.
