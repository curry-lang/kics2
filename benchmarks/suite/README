This directory contains a collection of benchmark programs
for the KiCS2 compiler. All benchmarks can be executed
by the script "showbench" from the parent directory.

Short explanations of the programs:

ReverseUser: first-order functional programming
naive reverse on user-defined lists

Reverse: first-order functional programming
naive reverse on built-in lists

Tak: first-order functional programming
highly recursive function on natural numbers

TakPeano: first-order functional programming
like Tak but with user-defined numbers in Peano representation

ReverseHO: higher-order functional programming
linear reverse with higher-order functions

ReverseBuiltin: higher-order functional programming
linear reverse from the Prelude

Primes: higher-order functional programming
compute prime numbers via sieve of Eratosthenes

PrimesPeano: higher-order functional programming
like Primes but with user-defined numbers in Peano representation
and user-defined lists

PrimesBuiltin: higher-order functional programming
like Primes but with built-in higher-order functions and lists

Queens: higher-order functional programming
compute number of safe positions of queens

QueensUser: higher-order functional programming
like Queens but with user-defined lists

PermSort: nondeterministic programming
sort a list by enumerating all permutations

PermSortPeano: nondeterministic operations
like PermSort but with Peano numbers

Half: nondeterministic programming with logic variables
compute the half of a number in Peano representation by adding an
unknown number to itself

NDNums: nondeterministic operations with complete search
operation the nondeterministically enumerates all natural numbers

ShareNonDet: nondeterministic operations
permutation sort applied to big primes to demonstrate sharing over nondet.

Last: nondeterministic programming with logic variables and unification
compute the last element of a list by solving a list equation

RegExp: nondeterministic programming with logic variables and unification
"grep" a pattern in a long string by a nondeterministic specification
of pattern matching
